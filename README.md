# Mumble

Simple video player based on FFMpeg libraries.

Written in C++.

# Support

It supports multiple backends:

+ None (For testing)
+ Debug (For testing)
+ Framebuffer (beta)
+ Terminal (TrueColor)

For terminal output I recommend `xterm`.

I having problems with framebuffer on Linux, therefore it's untestable on Linux.

# ToDo

- Audio output
- Terminal grayscale output for less terminal emulator lags
- SDL output
- Control support
